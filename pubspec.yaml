# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - .env
    - .env.review
    - lib/assets/images/
    - lib/assets/images/back/
    - lib/assets/images/menu/
    - lib/assets/images/auth/
    - lib/assets/images/slider/
    - lib/assets/images/tests/
    - lib/assets/images/roadmap/
    - lib/assets/images/footer/
    - lib/assets/images/lessonplan/
    - lib/assets/images/profile/
    - lib/assets/images/loading/
    - lib/assets/images/menu/view_content_report/
    - lib/assets/images/lucky-draw/

  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Nunito
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Nunito-Regular.ttf
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Nunito-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Nunito-Bold.ttf
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Nunito-SemiBold.ttf
    - family: NunitoMedium
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Nunito-Medium.ttf
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
    - family: PoppinsMedium
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf
    - family: PoppinsSemiBold
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
    - family: Lexend
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Lexend-Regular.ttf
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Lexend-SemiBold.ttf            

  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
